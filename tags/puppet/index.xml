      <description>You might&#39;ve heard about one of Puppet 6&#39;s freshfeatures: Deferred. It basically allows you to run code on agent during execution, instead of only on master during compilation.
It&#39;s awesome for many reasons; you can:
 retrieve secrets on agents, implement lazy execution and macros,  But it has one big problem. Let me show what&#39;s wrong.
Usage Try writing an example code with Deferred:
# manifest.pp$args = { now_on_master =&amp;gt; new(TimeStamp), shadow_contents =&amp;gt; Deferred(&amp;#39;file&amp;#39;, [&amp;#39;/etc/puppet_time.</description>
