      <description>Recently I began to wonder why is building software that interesting? I quite enjoy computer and tabletop games, and somehow simply building software seems to be at least as challenging and in turn rewarding.
The obvious answer: joy of creation Though I haven&#39;t done any research in that area, I&#39;m quite sure that in general people like creating - and by that expressing themselves, and losing themselves in the process. It seems a bit far-fetched to compare painting to writing code.</description>
